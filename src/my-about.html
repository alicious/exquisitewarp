      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Exquisite Warps is a collaboration tool for weavers in the style of the parlor game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>, designed and written by Ali Moore (weaver at <a href="http://www.catscradletextiles.com">Cat's Cradle Textiles</a>), and her husband Jonathan.</p>
      <p>Each Exquisite Warps composition is made of a series of warp segments. Segments are designed by participating weavers one at a time in turn, with each weaver only having access to the last few inches of the previous warp segment. The finished composition is intended to be the width of several warps, so that each weaver can be assigned to weave a subsection of the finished composition.</p>
